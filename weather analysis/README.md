## Weather Data Analysis ðŸ¥µðŸ¥¶

This data comes from a weather station located in San Diego, California. The weather station is equipped with sensors that capture weather-related 
measurements such as air temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity. Data was collected for a period of three years, from September 2011
to September 2014, to ensure that sufficient data for different seasons and weather conditions is captured.

### Dataset Description<br>
â€¢ rowID - unique number for each row (Unit: NA) <br>
â€¢ hpwrentimestamp - timestamp of measure (Unit: year-month-day hour:minute:second)<br>
â€¢ air pressure - air pressure measured at the timestamp (Unit: hectopascals)<br>
â€¢ air temp - air temperature measure at the timestamp (Unit: degrees Fahrenheit)<br>
â€¢ avg wind direction - wind direction averaged over the minute before the timestamp (Unit: degrees, with 0 means coming from     the North, and increasing clockwise)<br>
â€¢ avg wind speed - wind speed averaged over the minute before the timestamp (Unit: meters per second)<br>
â€¢ max wind direction - highest wind direction in the minute before the timestamp (Unit: degrees, with 0 being North and           increasing clockwise)<br>
â€¢ max wind speed - highest wind speed in the minute before the timestamp (Unit: meters per second)<br>
â€¢ min wind direction - smallest wind direction in the minute before the timestamp (Unit: degrees, with 0 being North and         inceasing clockwise)<br>
â€¢ min wind speed - smallest wind speed in the minute before the timestamp (Unit: meters per second)<br>
â€¢ rain accumulation - amount of accumulated rain measured at the timestamp (Unit: millimeters)<br>
â€¢ rain duration - length of time rain has fallen as measured at the timestamp (Unit: seconds)<br>
â€¢ relative humidity - relative humidity measured at the timestamp (Unit: percent)<br>
