# Academic-Projects
<br>  This repo contains some of the academic projects in Data Science in the junior year that I did under the guidance of various professors of the college, IITK. 
<br>
I will keep updating the repo with different problems I do. <br>
  The datasets are quite from Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository and some from sources which I don't recall xD.
I have also updated a readme for each folder with brief explanation of problem statement and steps. Hope that comes handy.

until then 
peace out!!
