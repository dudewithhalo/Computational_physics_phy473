# Academic-Projects
<br>  This repo contains some of the academic projects in data science in the junior year that I did while pursuing various complementary statistis and scientific computing course, at IITK. 
<br>
I will keep updating the repo with different problems I do.👻 <br>
  <br> Quite of these datasets are from Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository and some from sources which I don't recall xD.
I have also updated a readme for each folder with brief explanation of problem statement and steps. Hope that comes handy.

until then <br>
peace out!! ✌️
