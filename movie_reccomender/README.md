## Movie Reccomender
This repo contains codes for the **movie recommender system**.
<br>
The dataset was available on Kaggle by the name of tmdb - the movie database. It is a quite an elaborate dataset and pretty much sufficed for my task. <br>
Algoritthm employed is `KMeans` and PCA had been used to establish significant attributes to work with.
