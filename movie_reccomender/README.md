 <ul> A Recommender System is class of information filtering system that tries to predict the rating or preference of a product for an user. On a more simple note, a recommender system tries to understand the user‚Äôs interests and provide contents to the user based on its understanding. Now- a-days the usage of good recommender system is universal, be it in recommending similar songs to the user (Spotify), similar movies or tv-shows to the user (Netflix, Amazon Prime etc.), similar videos to the users (YouTube, TikTok etc). It has also been developed in many other areas such as online-shopping, research articles, collaborators, and financial services.
