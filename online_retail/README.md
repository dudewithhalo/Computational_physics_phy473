##  Online data analysis and insights for Improved Marketing Strategy 

  The dataset is from *kaggle* featuring an UK-based registered non-store online retail. Techniques used are domniantly `KMeans` to establish clusters and
  `Assocaite Rule Mining` to deploy more effective consumer marketing .
  - Utilised the RFM (recency, frequency, monetary values)
  - Used `Apriori algorithm` of market basket analysis to mine association rules from the large # of tranxs.
